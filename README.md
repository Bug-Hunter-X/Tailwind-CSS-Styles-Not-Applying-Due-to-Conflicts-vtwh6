# Tailwind CSS Styling Conflict Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applied correctly due to conflicts or specificity issues.  The problem is that a component's styling might be unexpectedly overridden, resulting in visual discrepancies.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file shows example usage where a simple component is expected to have a red background and padding.  However, depending on the setup (e.g., other CSS rules, conflicting classes) the styles might not be applied correctly.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the conflict through several methods:
* **Specificity:** Using more specific CSS selectors to override conflicting styles.
* **Important Flag (Use Sparingly):**  As a last resort, using the `!important` flag (use cautiously).
* **Class Ordering:** Carefully adjusting the order of utility classes to ensure correct application of styles.
* **Debugging Tools:** Using your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's styles and identify any conflicting styles.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install any necessary dependencies (if any exist).
3. Inspect the provided components and compare their behavior to identify the issue and solution.
